# Profiles
Profiles are a way of grouping triggers together. They're both organizational and functional. Profiles can be either active or inactive. While inactive none of the triggers inside of a profile will get triggered. Additionally Channel Point rewards and SpellCast spells used in inactive profiles will disappear so viewers cannot use them.

## Activation State
Profiles have three activation styles that you can control from the profile list.
- Forced Off
- Automatic 
- Forced On

## Activation Conditions
When a profile is set to Automatic it will follow the activation conditions inside the profile. You can construct logical expressions to automatically enable and disable the profile based on the internal state values of CastMate.\
For example, here is a profile that will only be active while I'm on my "Just Camera" scene in OBS.
